# Fourier_Neural_Network
There are currently three files as ipython notebook. The first one __simple_FNO_JAX is the implementation of the Burger's equation. The dataset for the same has been obtained from the matlab which is inherent in the code itself.
The second one Vorticity_2D_FNO is the python notebook which is the implementation of the 2D implementation of the Fourier Neural Network in JAX/OPTAX/Equinox. This is the most probably first (practically none till date ) which implements the FNO 2D in the JAX Equinox framework.
The dataset is obtained from the Naiver_Stokes_Data.ipynb this is barotropic vorticity equation.
